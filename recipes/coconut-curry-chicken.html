        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A flavorful homemade curry for dinner can be just as easy as a grilled cheese or quick stir-fry, and this recipe is perfect proof. Chicken breast strips are seared until browned, then coated in tomato paste, chili flakes, and aromatic spices. It’s all simmered in creamy, nutty, mildly sweet coconut milk, then finished with bite-sized pieces of sautéed kale. Spoon it all over steamy basmati rice for soaking up every last drop of curry.</p>
